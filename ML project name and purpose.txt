 Gender Recognition using CNN
2)Developed a gender detection system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as part of a team.Collected a labeled dataset of face images with corresponding gender labels (male/female).Preprocessed the data and augmented it for better training.Designed a CNN model architecture with convolutional and fully connected layers to learn features and classify genders.Trained the model using optimization techniques and validated it on a separate dataset.The model achieved an accuracy of 95% on the validation dataset.This system can be used to reliably detect the gender of
